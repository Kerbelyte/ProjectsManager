# Projects manager system

This is my second project built with PHP and SQL!
This project implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

## It allows:

* Create, Read, Update and Delete employees and projects;
* Add employees to projects;
* Add projects to employees;
* Remove employees from projects;
* Remove projects from employees;

## Installation

* Clone the repository;
* Import 'projects.sql' script into local SQL Server and create a database;
* Open the path where you can launch php interpreter, e.g. http://localhost/ProjectsManager/index.php;
